# OpenVPN Access Server 

Based on the [deprecated] <https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openvpn-as> running the latest version of the `openvpn-as` over Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS

On active development, may contains bugs.

## Application Setup

The admin interface is available at `https://DOCKER-HOST-IP:943/admin` (assuming bridge mode) with a default user/password of admin/password

During first login, make sure that the "Authentication" in the webui is set to "Local" instead of "PAM". Then set up the user accounts with their passwords (user accounts created under PAM do not survive container update or recreation).

The "admin" account is a system (PAM) account and after container update or recreation, its password reverts back to the default. It is highly recommended to block this user's access for security reasons:
1) Create another user and set as an admin,
2) Log in as the new user,
3) Delete the "admin" user in the gui,
4) Modify the `as.conf` file under config/etc and replace the line `boot_pam_users.0=admin` with ~~`#boot_pam_users.0=admin`~~ `boot_pam_users.0=kjhvkhv` (this only has to be done once and will survive container recreation)  
* IMPORTANT NOTE: Commenting out the first pam user in as.conf creates issues in 2.7.5. To make it work while still blocking pam user access, uncomment that line and change admin to a random nonexistent user as described above.

To ensure your devices can connect to your VPN properly, goto Configuration -> Network Settings -> and change the "Hostname or IP Address" section to either your domain name or public ip address.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose ([recommended](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  openvpn-as:
    image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/openvpn-as
    container_name: openvpn-as
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - INTERFACE=eth0 #optional
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
    ports:
      - 943:943
      - 9443:9443
      - 1194:1194/udp
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=openvpn-as \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e INTERFACE=eth0 `#optional` \
  -p 943:943 \
  -p 9443:9443 \
  -p 1194:1194/udp \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/linuxserver/openvpn-as
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 943` | Admin GUI port. |
| `-p 9443` | TCP port. |
| `-p 1194/udp` | UDP port. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |
| `-e INTERFACE=eth0` | With bridge networking, leave it as eth0 (or don't include at all), if host or macvlan, set it to your host's network interface, found by running `ifconfig` |
| `-v /config` | Where openvpn-as should store configuration files. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

[![Docker Universal Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?color=94398d&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&label=universal&query=%24.mods%5B%27universal%27%5D.mod_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinuxserver%2Fdocker-mods%2Fmaster%2Fmod-list.yml)](https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=universal "view available universal mods.")

We publish various [Docker Mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods) to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above.

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it openvpn-as /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f openvpn-as`
* container version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' openvpn-as`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' ghcr.io/linuxserver/openvpn-as`

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull openvpn-as`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d openvpn-as`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/linuxserver/openvpn-as`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop openvpn-as`
* Delete the container: `docker rm openvpn-as`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Watchtower auto-updater (only use if you don't remember the original parameters)

* Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one run:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower \
  --run-once openvpn-as
  ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

**Note:** We do not endorse the use of Watchtower as a solution to automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact we generally discourage automated updates. However, this is a useful tool for one-time manual updates of containers where you have forgotten the original parameters. In the long term, we highly recommend using [Docker Compose](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose).

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

* We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openvpn-as.git
cd docker-openvpn-as
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t ghcr.io/linuxserver/openvpn-as:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.
